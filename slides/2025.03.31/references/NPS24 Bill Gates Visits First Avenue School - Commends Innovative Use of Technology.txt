Newark, NJ – First Avenue School proudly welcomed esteemed technology visionary, Bill Gates. Mr. Gates toured the school to witness firsthand its groundbreaking implementation of Khan Academy and the pilot implementation of Khanmigo, an innovative educational tool.

First Avenue School has emerged the District’s leader in leveraging technology to enhance student learning. Through the integration of Khan Academy, particularly in Mathematics, the school has transformed its instructional approach, aligning skills with the curriculum to support personalized learning paths for students.

Khan Academy's data-driven platform empowers teachers to gather insightful data, enabling them to tailor individualized learning experiences for students. This approach not only reinforces essential skills but also challenges learners to excel, fostering a dynamic and engaging educational environment.

In addition to Khan Academy, First Avenue School is piloting the use of Khanmigo, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool designed to support educators and students in grades 5-8. With Khanmigo, educators can access recommended student problems, analyze class trends, and streamline administrative tasks, ultimately saving valuable time and enabling focused attention on student needs.

"First Avenue School's pioneering use of Khan Academy and Khanmigo epitomizes our pledge to harnessing technology to empower every student with personalized learning experiences across the District. By embracing innovation, the school leadership team from the North, principal and school administrators, teachers and staff are preparing our students to be the digital citizens the world needs.  And in doing so across the city, we are transforming education in Newark,” said Superintendent Leὀn.
